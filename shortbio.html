	<p class="card-text"> Casie Meyer is a junior at the University of Iowa. She's studying environmental engineering, and pursuing a minor in 
	geographical information science. She pursued this course of study because of her interest in climate change and sustainability related topics.
	So far, in her academic career, she's enjoyed chemistry-based classes the most, because they've taught her the most practical information about
	she can use in her career. She's also enjoyed several math classes. When she graduates from college, she wants to use her degree to work in water
	wastewater treatment. She believes that clean water is a human right and wants to do her part to ensure that as many people as possible have access
	to clean water. When she's not studying or doing homework, she works as a student research assistant at the University of Iowa's Center for Health
	Effects of Environmental Contamination, on the Get the Lead Out Initiative. She's also served as a TA for a few classes. In her free time she likes
	to read, hang out with her friends, and try new restaurants. </p>
