	The main observation of flow pattens to be made is that the northern
	countries (Brazil, Ecuador) send most of the bananas to the southern countries (Chile, Argentina). All of
	the largest flows go from north to south, while some smaller ones move from south to north. I think this
	could be for a couple of reasons. First, the northern countries have more vegetated land, whereas the
	southern countries have more desert and barren land. This can be seen with the slightly transparent
	chloropleth map. The largest and smallest flows correspond with the land that’s most suitable for
	growing crops. Second, there are a few big cities (Buenos Aires, Santiago) in southern South America.
	Because some of the southern countries have higher population density, there’s more people in them to
	eat bananas, and so more are imported into the country. This is shown by the large nodes in some
	southern countries, representing a high total flow of bananas. Third, the northern countries are
	extremely close to the Equator. This means that their climate is tropical, and is suitable for growing
	bananas. The climate of these countries allows them to grow much more bananas than the southern
	countries. Conversely, some of the southernmost points in certain countries, like Argentina or Chile are
	close to Antarctica. This means that their climates are climates are not suitable for growing bananas.
	Because of this, these countries would have to import more bananas to meet demand.
